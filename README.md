# Minecraft Custom Villager Trader Generator
What a mouthful...

## Usage
#### Items
Make custom items by creating json files in the `items/` directory.  
Use `feather-v2.json` as a reference.  
#### Villagers
Make custom villagers by creating json files in the `villagers/` directory.  
Use `magic-trader.json` as a reference.  
#### Generate
Run `python generate.py <VILLAGER_FILE_NAME_WITHOUT_DOT_JSON>` in a terminal.  
Alternatively you may omit the villager file name, in which case all villagers get generated.
